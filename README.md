# NetworkComparisonTest

Statistical comparison of two networks with respect to three invariance measures

Network approaches to psychometric constructs, in which constructs are modeled in terms of interactions between their constituent factors, have rapidly gained popularity in psychology. Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. 

This package facilitates this recent movements by providing the necessary methodological tools. The Network Comparison Test (NCT) uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of 1) network structure, 2) edge (connection) strength, and 3) global strength.
