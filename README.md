# NetworkComparisonTest
Statistical comparison of two networks with respect to three invariance measures

I am no longer working in academia. It was time for a change. ;-) To tackle most of the questions I get, I updated the NCT package and add example code of the new functionalities in the help file. 
You can now use NCT in combination with the estimateNetwork() function. This enables using various network estimation methods (e.g., mgm). Also, you can find example code for assessing differences in various centrality measures (e.g., bridge centrality). You can find the most recent version on GitHub. This version will soon be uploaded to CRAN.
For now, I will still be available for questions in case you get errors or something via cvborkulo@gmail.com. If your question needs a more involved answer, I might refer you to another expert. ;-)
